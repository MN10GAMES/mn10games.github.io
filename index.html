                Hi, I'm Malick a 20 year old gamer from Senegal.<br /><br />
                Having played games my whole life, I always dreamed of one day making my own.<br />
                With no intentions of letting go of this goal, I traveled to France after my high-school graduation
                to take Software Engineering classes thus beginning my journey.<br /><br />
                Now in my second year I have already released my first game and am working on the second one as you read this.<br /><br />
                What makes my games special you may ask? Well, It's simple I may answer ! <br />
                They're made by a gamer first and foremost.<br />
                This means no experience-deterring practices such as ads or microtransactions.<br />
                Why? Because it's all supposed to be fun and games !
